0: The secret message is: When using a stream cipher, never use the key more than once
1: The Concise OxfordDictionary (2006) defines crypto as the art of writing or solving codes.
2: A (private-key)  encryption scheme states 3 algorithms, namely a procedure for generating keys, a procedure for encrypting, and a procedure for decrypting.
3: We can see the point where the chip is unhappy if a wrong bit is sent and consumes more power from the environment - Adi Shamir
4: You don't want to buy a set of car keys from a guy who specializes in stealing cars - Marc Rotenberg commenting on Clipper
5: Euler would probably enjoy that now his theorem becomes a corner stone of crypto - Annonymous on Euler's theorem
6: We can factor the number 15 with quantum computers. We can also factor the number 15 with a dog trained to bark three times - Robert Harley
7: The ciphertext produced by a weak encryption algorithm looks as good as ciphertext produced by a strong encryption algorithm - Philip Zimmermann
8: The nice thing about Keeyloq is now we cryptographers can drive a lot of fancy cars - Dan Boneh
9: There are two types of cryptography - that which will keep secrets safe from your little sister, and that which will keep secrets safe from your government - Bruce Schneier
10: There are two types of cyptography: one that allows the Government to use brute force to break the code, and one that requires the Government to use brute force to break your privacy
